# odin-library

The live webpage for this project can be found [here](https://nathaniel-lowy.github.io/odin-library/).

Based on [the Odin Project's Library project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library) as part of their Full Stack Javascript curriculum.

This library project allows users to enter books with titles, authors, page counts, and whether or not the book has been read. The read status can be toggled, and books can be removed. Currently, persistent storage is not included, as it is out of the scope of the course at this point. I will come back and add it either later in the course (if that is indeed part of the lesson plan) or else when I am finished.
